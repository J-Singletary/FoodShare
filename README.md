## Overview
### Description
The FoodShare app is an app to help nearby on-campus students share excess food with each other. They can post excess food that they have and request food from others on-campus. If someone has something they would like to share, they can private message the student and collaborate on when and where to meet up. This app is meant to help students get to know their neighbors and to reduce food waste on-campus.
